# LatchingObject - NO LONGER MAINTAINED; please see https://github.com/Ratimus/SequencerTools
Arduino library for a template class that behaves like a hardware latch or register--a value on its input will not appear on the output until it is clocked. Useful for time-synchronizing state changes or for comparing upcoming state to current state before updating.
